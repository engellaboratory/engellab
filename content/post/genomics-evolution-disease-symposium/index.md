## Description
The Genomics, Evolution, Disease Symposium provides a forum for Temple University (and Temple-affiliated) genomicists to meet and discuss recent discoveries and innovations in the fields of evolution and disease. This year, we will begin with a meet-and-greet luncheon at noon, followed by a brief introduction by Michele Masucci, Vice-President for Research. Two sessions of talks and a poster session will highlight the diverse array of genomic-based research at Temple. Dr. Jeff Townsend (Yale) will give a special keynote talk on his work intersecting genomics, evolution, and disease. Finally, we will have a chance to chat more at the happy hour reception.

## Public Health Relevance

Beckwith-Wiedeman Syndrome (BWS) is a fetal overgrowth disorder which confers high risk for pediatric cancers. The steps that progressively disorganize the genes in the KCNQ1 region are not known. New technologies will be applied to cells from BWS patients, providing a useful paradigm for understanding the events that are misregulated in cancer and offering an opportunity to test novel epigenetic therapeutic strategies. We will perform conformational, epigenetic and expression studies to compare normal fibroblasts and cells from BWS patients. These comparisons will elucidate how expression of critical genes is disrupted. We will mimic alterations of patient cells in normal fibroblasts to determine the step-wise events that affect cell growth. In addition, we will exploit epigenetic fusion proteins to rescue the normal phenotype of the patient cells. Because current epigenetic therapies act in a genome-wide manner, successful modification of specific loci with epigenetic editors portends a highly targeted therapy applicable to any cancer with deregulated gene expression.
