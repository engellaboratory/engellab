We are seeking postdocs who are excited about epigenetics, transcriptional regulation, and the dynamics of molecular sex differences throughout embryonic development. Some computational experience is required.  Please apply by sending a CV, cover letter, and information for three references. [Click here](/post/postdoc-listing/) to learn more

Note to prospective students:
Students interested in genetics, development and sex differences in health and disease and who are interested in combining computational and experimental approaches are strongly encouraged to rotate in the lab.  All graduate students must apply through [Temple University's PhD program](https://medicine.temple.edu/education/biomedical-sciences-graduate-program)
