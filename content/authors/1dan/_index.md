I received my Bachelor’s degree in Biology at Temple University, where I was fortunate enough to work in a lab and experience the fascinating process of research. Throughout my time as an undergraduate, I developed a deep interest in evolution, molecular biology, and epigenetics, leading me to pursue a career investigating how these fields define the world around us. Continuing my education, I received my Professional Science Master’s degree in Biotechnology from Temple University. In the lab, I enjoy training new students and watching them develop as scientists. Outside of the lab, my hobbies include leatherworking, cobbling, and hanging with my three cats Lucy, Fig, and Junebug.
