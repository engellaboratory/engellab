I have a B.S. in bioengineering and a minor in chemistry from Temple University and am currently an MD/PhD student at LKSOM and a recipient of the pre-doctoral T32 fellowship. My research background is in fluorescence microscopy, organoid development & histopathology, mathematical modeling in Python and Matlab, of voting systems and cell growth respectively. I also have background in medical device design, electrospinning, and cell spraying in wound healing applications. My current research interests are in cancer genetics, sex differences in disease, cancer development, and 3D modelling of disease via organoid models. Medically, my interests are in pathology, GI, and family medicine.
