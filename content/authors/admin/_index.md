Dr. Nora Engel is Associate Professor at the [Coriell Institute for Medical Research](https://www.coriell.org/), which is a partner in the [Camden Cancer Research Center](https://www.coriell.org/ccrcnj/) in Camden, NJ. Nora received her Ph.D. in Molecular Genetics from the University of Buenos Aires School of Biochemistry. Her graduate work focused on transcriptional regulation in cancer. She then pursued a postdoctoral fellowship in the laboratory of Dr. Marisa Bartolomei at the University of Pennsylvania, where she investigated mechanisms of genomic imprinting during embryogenesis in mouse models. 

As an independent investigator, Nora continued her studies on how imprinted regions are regulated and how the epigenetic and three-dimensional conformation is disturbed in imprinting disorders.

Currently Noraâ€™s major interest is in how sex differences are established in somatic tissues during embryogenesis, how the sex chromosomes contribute independently to those differences at the transcriptional and epigenetic levels and how these differences are reflected in sex disparities in cancer risk and outcomes, using melanoma as a paradigmatic non-reproductive cancer that is male-biased.
