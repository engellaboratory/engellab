# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: "I earned my B.S. in Molecular Biology and a minor in Applied Mathematics from The College of New Jersey, where I first started my research career. As an undergraduate, I studied neurodegeneration and infertility in C. elegans using confocal and fluorescence microscopy techniques. I also completed an internship at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine where I was an NIH funded CREATE scholar and studied the epigenetics of Acute Myeloid Leukemia using human cell lines as well as mouse models. Furthermore, I have professional experience as a Laboratory Assistant at Rutgers-New Brunswick. My current research interests are cancer epigenetics, stem cell epigenetics, cancer treatments, sex differences in cancer, and X chromosome inactivation. Outside of the lab I like to crochet, sculpt, paint, and play video games. "
