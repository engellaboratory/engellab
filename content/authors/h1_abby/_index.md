# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: "I earned my B.S. in Molecular Biology and a minor in Applied Mathematics from The College of New Jersey, where I first started my research career. As an undergraduate, I studied neurodegeneration and infertility in C. elegans using confocal and fluorescence microscopy techniques. I also completed an internship at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine where I was an NIH funded CREATE scholar and studied the epigenetics of Acute Myeloid Leukemia using human cell lines as well as mouse models. Furthermore, I have professional experience as a Laboratory Assistant at Rutgers-New Brunswick. My current research interests are cancer epigenetics, stem cell epigenetics, cancer treatments, sex differences in cancer, and X chromosome inactivation. Outside of the lab I like to crochet, sculpt, paint, and play video games. "

I have a B.S. in bioengineering and a minor in chemistry from Temple University and am currently an MD/PhD student at LKSOM and a recipient of the pre-doctoral T32 fellowship. My research background is in fluorescence microscopy, organoid development & histopathology, mathematical modeling in Python and Matlab, of voting systems and cell growth respectively. I also have background in medical device design, electrospinning, and cell spraying in wound healing applications. My current research interests are in cancer genetics, sex differences in disease, cancer development, and 3D modelling of disease via organoid models. Medically, my interests are in pathology, GI, and family medicine.
